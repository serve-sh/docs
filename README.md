# Documentation

The official API documentation for [serve.sh](https://serve.sh)

Coming soon!

## Contributing

In order to contribute to the documentation, it will be helpful to serve your changes locally so you can preview your edits in real-time.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- pip
- mkdocs

### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the following command to start the local server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

You should see output like the following:

```
INFO    -  Documentation built in 0.30 seconds
INFO    -  [14:10:45] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
INFO    -  [14:10:45] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8000` where you can preview your changes.
